# Product API

## üöÄ Features
- **Retrieve all products**: Easily fetch a list of all products stored in the database.
- **Create a new product**: Add new products by submitting relevant product information (name, price, description).
- **Upload product images**:  
  - Utilizes **Multer** middleware to handle `multipart/form-data` for image uploads.  
  - Configured to enforce a **file size limit** (e.g., maximum 5MB per file) to prevent oversized uploads.  
  - Supports filtering file types to accept only image formats (JPEG, PNG, etc.) for security and consistency.  
  - Upon upload, images are stored on **Cloudinary**, providing reliable CDN delivery, automatic optimization, and easy management.  
  - Cloudinary configuration allows setting transformation parameters (e.g., resizing, compression) so that images meet specific size requirements before saving.
